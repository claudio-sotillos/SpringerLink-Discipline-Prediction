# SpringerLink-Discipline-Prediction
In this project we try to predict to which disciplines certain articles, books and papers belong.  We have divided the work into two main tasks.   
In Task 1, we apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) on the abstracts of these articles. 
We ended up producing a graph with the Gephi application, which allows us to better understand how our articles are related.  


In Task 2, starting from the previous NLP analysis, we try to predict the discipline of the articles in the test subset, through different methods.
