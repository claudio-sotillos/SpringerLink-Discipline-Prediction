See an example:  \n","https://link.springer.com/search/page/1?facet-discipline=%22Biomedicine%22&facet-language=%22En%22&facet-content-type=Article <br>\n","Of course, the section '%22Biomedicine%22' changes for each discipline, but since we have gathered the url of each discipline we don't have to worry about changing that piece for moving into another discipline.\n","\n","That is why we first did an initial 'outer' web scraping obtaining the Article´s title and url. This web scraping consisted on a loop along the Discipline´s Urls \n","obtaining 2000 [title,url, discipline name] instances per Discipline, obtaining a total of 20000 instances (then it is reduced since some articles didn´t have abstract).\n","\n","Finally, the 'inner' web scraping went through the Url´s column,and obtained the remaining features (which were inside of the own article page). \n","The first web scraping took like an hour to complete and the second one took 4 hours. \n","We guess that there is a more efficient way of doing this but this is what we have been able to do. \n","\n","Once we generated a pandas df of all the features, we deleted those rows which didn´t contain an abstract, since these are useles for the topic modelling task.\n","\n","<h1>Let´s Proceed
